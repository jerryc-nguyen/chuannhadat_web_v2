Overview: 
Each product will have many images. 
when render complete on listing page each product will have a carousel images but we have to optimize the initialize for performance and SEO
The carousel built on embla-carousel library 
I want the flow should look like:
1. when SSR we just show the first images used for SEO product - thumbnail style
2. when user in viewport - load complete we will initialize the embla carousel but only for first image, show pagination for images count
3. when user click view next images in carousel - we will preload all other images
====
SEO: Render only the first image per product on the server (SSR) for crawlers, with structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets.
Performance: Show one image per product initially (fast LCP), initialize carousels for the first 6 products after hydration, and lazy-init others when in viewport using IntersectionObserver.
Scalability: Use pagination, caching, and minimal client-side JS to handle 20 products efficiently.
Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, react-intersection-observer for viewport detection, and Next/Image for optimized images.
